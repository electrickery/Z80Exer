!Z80Exer - an Arduino based Z80 board exercizer

A long time ago (well 2014), I developed the original Z80Exersizer, to be able to check Z80 based boards from the Z80 CPU
socket. It worked and I announced this on the VCF-forum (then called vintagecomputer.org). Eventually I added some specific
features to test a TRS-80 Model 1, but mostly the project was halted.

At one time David Mutimer became interested and added the option to control the Model 1 from the expansion bus. Another feature was the much improved testing of the dynamic RAM.

Originally I used a experiment print between the Arduino Mega 2560, but with the TRS80 bus added this would get too complex, so in 2020 I created a shield, and included a connector for the TRS-80 connector to mke it more versatile. The code was somewhat more optimized.

Now the versions I still had in .tgz files are uploaded here in github, and the work of David Mutimer is in a separate branch DMutimer. It should be a clean merge.
